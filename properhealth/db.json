      "data": "Eczema is a common, chronic and complex skin disease that arises as a result of interactions between genes and the environment (1). This inflammatory skin condition affects 15-20% of children and 1-3% of adults worldwide (2).  Erin Quense, Registered Dietitian Nutritionist says that the causes of eczema can vary from person to person and without a single pathology, no one diet can be found to cure it. However, links have been found between diet and keeping eczema symptoms under control.Quense says that although a lot of the research around diet and eczema has been inconclusive, a 2017 cross-sectional study found an association between junk food and increased severity and prevalence of eczema. The study also found that the most common patient-reported triggers were dairy, gluten, alcohol and sugar. More than half of the participants reported that eliminating flour, gluten, processed or high-fat foods led to positive outcomes (3).Given that eczema is a skin disease that affects everyone differently and with different causes from person to person, DJ Mazzoni, Registered Dietitian and Medical Reviewer at Illuminate Labs recommends that people suffering from eczema keep a journal of foods and eczema flare ups. “You may find that you’re having regular reactions to a food that you’ve eaten your whole life, and never would have considered eliminating from your diet.” Mazzoni says that generally, foods like fresh fruits and vegetables, wild-caught fish and legumes don’t cause eczema flares, but any food could cause a flare in a patient with an allergy or sensitivity to that food.

      "data": "Acne is a chronic, multifactorial skin condition that is estimated to affect 9.4% of the global population, putting it in the top ten most common diseases worldwide (1). With almost 10% of the global population suffering from acne at some point in their lifetime, it seems important to understand more about it. As there are many factors that can cause acne, emerging research shows that diet can play an important role. We spoke to several Registered Dietitians to discuss the relationship between diet and acne, what foods to eat, which ones to avoid and how nutrition tracking can help uncover foods that can cause flare ups in acne. Registered Dietitian at Exercise with Style, Kristin Gillespie says that there is certainly a link between diet and acne. Foods high in refined grains and sugars (high-glycemic index) and dairy products are most often associated with acne (2). This is believed to be related to the impact of these foods on blood sugar levels, as a result, circulating insulin levels. Eczema is a common, chronic and complex skin disease that arises as a result of interactions between genes and the environment (1). This inflammatory skin condition affects 15-20% of children and 1-3% of adults worldwide (2).
